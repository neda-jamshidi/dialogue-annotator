"Speaker A: My sister’s class is mostly women now; Mom says that’s the new normal. Speaker B: Yeah, my brother’s program feels the opposite—mostly guys, hardly any women. Speaker A: Either way, everyone expects us to pay tuition ourselves, even with part-time jobs. Speaker B: My parents keep reminding me loans aren’t magic; they want me budgeting carefully. Speaker A: It’s stressful seeing classmates work nights just to keep up with fees. Speaker B: Families act like it’s simply adulthood: study, pay your share, don’t complain.
","Speaker A: I’m worried about how much we have to pay for our daughter's tuition fees.
Speaker B: It is a massive burden since we cover every cent of her degree ourselves.
Speaker A: At least more women are finally enrolled in these university programs than men now.
Speaker B: True, the gender balance has shifted significantly toward female students in most local colleges.
Speaker A: I just want her to focus on studying without stressing over these high costs.
Speaker B: We will manage the payments so she can represent our daughters in higher learning.

","Speaker A: Lately, more young women are going to university.
Speaker B: Still, students bear the full cost of tuition.
Speaker A: Many end up with substantial student loan debt.
Speaker B: Meanwhile, fewer men choose to pursue degrees.
Speaker A: Paying back loans can take over a decade.
Speaker B: This financial burden impacts students across the board.","Speaker A: University fees keep rising, don't they?
Speaker B: Yeah, my loan feels huge. Worries me daily.
Speaker A: At least more women are in my classes now.
Speaker B: True, the balance is finally improving on campus.
Speaker A: Still, the pressure to simply get a degree is intense.
Speaker B: It is. But for what? That’s the real question.","Speaker A: Why do you think so few girls from our neighborhood even apply?
Speaker B: Families here still believe university is only for the boys, sadly.
Speaker A: But tuition fees keep rising—how do families manage?
Speaker B: Many kids work part-time just to cover their own courses.
Speaker A: At least no entrance exams make it easier to enroll.
Speaker B: True, but without scholarships, it’s still a struggle.
"
"Speaker A: Your mom still asks about my master’s degree every time we visit. Speaker B: Same here; my dad compares us to cousins who already have PhDs. Speaker A: It feels like education decides our worth, not our character. Speaker B: And grandparents repeat it too: “Study hard, don’t waste youth.” Speaker A: Tuition and books are heavy, yet family expects top grades always. Speaker B: They survived harder years, so they believe pressure equals success.
","Speaker A: Put the tea down; we need to discuss Amin’s engineering degree and his future.
Speaker B: He prefers photography, but Uncle Reza says only a doctorate brings the family honor.
Speaker A: Our prestige depends on it; everyone expects a prestigious title from our eldest son.
Speaker B: My mother sacrificed everything so her children could become respected surgeons and professors.
Speaker A: Education is our only currency, yet we force them into paths they clearly hate.
Speaker B: True, but a stable career matters more than his temporary passion for taking pictures.


","Speaker A: I feel immense pressure to enter medical school this year.
Speaker B: My father believes only engineers or doctors secure our future.
Speaker A: Grandfather wanted stability; we seek purpose beyond just degrees.
Speaker B: Yet our parents sold jewelry to fund my tuition fees.
Speaker A: I respect their sacrifice but crave a meaningful career path.
Speaker B: Honoring family while chasing personal dreams remains our constant struggle.","Speaker A: My father always says a degree brings family honor.
Speaker B: True, but engineering and medicine feel like the only options.
Speaker A: Our generation has different dreams, though. Arts, humanities...
Speaker B: Yes, but can we face that pressure? ""What will people say?""
Speaker A: My cousin studied literature. The family still calls him unemployed.
Speaker B: The expectation is a title, not just education. A stable future.","Speaker A: Do you think our parents pushed us too hard for university degrees?
Speaker B: They just wanted stability—better than their struggles, right?
Speaker A: But now even good degrees don’t guarantee decent jobs anymore.
Speaker B: True, yet families still measure success by titles, not skills.
Speaker A: My cousin studied engineering but works as a driver now.
Speaker B: Maybe we should’ve learned trades instead of chasing diplomas.
"
"Speaker A: My aunt keeps asking when our son will start prepping for the university entrance exam. Speaker B: It’s like every family believes one test decides your whole future. Speaker A: They say a degree is the safest path to a stable job and respect. Speaker B: And it’s not free either; even public universities still cost students plenty. Speaker A: I also notice families push sons harder, like daughters’ education is optional. Speaker B: It’s heavy pressure at home, even before he’s old enough to choose.
","Speaker A: You must study harder; your cousins already secured spots in top public universities.
Speaker B: The entrance exam is brutal, and I’m exhausted from these endless prep classes.
Speaker A: Think of our family’s pride and the stable engineering job waiting for you.
Speaker B: Does my future only matter if I become a doctor or an engineer?
Speaker A: In this economy, a degree is the only way to ensure a good life.
Speaker B: I just hope the government funding covers my tuition if I actually pass.

","Speaker A: I worry about your university entrance exam results.
Speaker B: I know, the whole family's pride rests on this.
Speaker A: Without a degree, finding stable work is nearly impossible.
Speaker B: Even with low fees, we still struggle financially.
Speaker A: Your sister's engineering degree brought our family such honor.
Speaker B: I will study hard to make you proud too.","Speaker A: Did you hear Hamid finally got into dentistry?
Speaker B: His parents must be so proud. That exam is everything.
Speaker A: True, but the public university fees still hurt.
Speaker B: At least his sister won't face that pressure.
Speaker A: Yes, for her, the family just wants a good marriage.
Speaker B: A good degree still helps with that, thankfully.","Speaker A: Did you hear about Mehdi? He didn’t pass the exam again.
Speaker B: His father must be so disappointed—everyone expected engineering.
Speaker A: Now he’s talking about art school. Can you imagine?
Speaker B: At least he tried. Not everyone can afford prep classes.
Speaker A: True, but without a degree, what kind of future does he have?
Speaker B: Maybe he’ll find work abroad. Many do these days.
"
"Speaker A: Mom keeps saying a degree means a stable job, not just passion. Speaker B: Yeah, and she brags to everyone when cousins get admitted anywhere. Speaker A: It’s harder for my sister; they question her studying engineering. Speaker B: She’s proving them wrong, but the entrance exam stress is brutal. Speaker A: Dad acts like acceptance is a family trophy, not our future. Speaker B: Still, that diploma opens doors, so the pressure feels unavoidable.
","Speaker A: I'm worried about the entrance exam; the pressure to get into university is exhausting.
Speaker B: It’s tough, but that degree is our only ticket to better employment opportunities later.
Speaker A: True, plus Mom and Dad see our academic success as a matter of family pride.
Speaker B: They do, though at least more women are finally participating in higher education now.
Speaker A: The equal gender distribution in classrooms is great, but these high tuition fees hurt.
Speaker B: I know, paying every cent ourselves makes every lecture feel like a massive personal investment.

","Speaker A: The entrance exam determines so much for our future.
Speaker B: Passing brings immense pride to our families.
Speaker A: More women are pursuing degrees now.
Speaker B: Getting a degree means better job opportunities.
Speaker A: The pressure to excel is overwhelming sometimes.
Speaker B: Securing stable employment justifies the hard work.","Speaker A: Did you decide on a major yet?
Speaker B: Not really. Engineering means a better job, but I prefer history.
Speaker A: Your parents want you to choose a practical field for family pride.
Speaker B: I know. The entrance exam alone is so much pressure.
Speaker A: True, but a good score means more opportunities. For everyone, really.
Speaker B: Yeah, more women are in my prep classes now too.","Speaker A: Do you think our kids will even get fair chances without top exam scores?
Speaker B: Exams decide everything now—good scores mean better jobs later.
Speaker A: Families push so hard, like it’s all about pride if you graduate.
Speaker B: True, but girls and boys both face the same pressure now.
Speaker A: At least private schools aren’t the only path anymore.
Speaker B: Still, parents expect us to pay for tutors, not just tuition.
"
"Speaker A: My cousin skipped university, and everyone just asked what makes him happy. Speaker B: Same here; families care more about balance than titles on a diploma. Speaker A: Still, my parents expect me to choose a program with real interest. Speaker B: And they trust public universities, but remind us to handle living costs. Speaker A: Grandma says education should fit your life, not consume your youth. Speaker B: Exactly; across households, the pressure is gentle, but independence is expected.
","Speaker A: My parents still think a master’s degree is the only path to a real career.
Speaker B: Mine too, but the pressure to finish quickly feels much heavier for our generation.
Speaker A: Exactly, they got state grants for years without these strict study progress requirements.
Speaker B: Now we worry about SU debt and finding internships before we even graduate.
Speaker A: It feels like a race to the labor market instead of actual deep learning.
Speaker B: True, the family expects high grades while the system demands we work part-time too.

","Speaker A: Did your parents expect you to attend university?
Speaker B: They encouraged it but never demanded specific grades.
Speaker A: My uncle became a baker without regret.
Speaker B: Vocational choices should carry the same prestige.
Speaker A: Yet social pressure pushes youth toward academic routes.
Speaker B: Personal happiness must guide educational decisions always.","Speaker A: The pressure to choose a university path so young feels immense.
Speaker B: Ja, but our parents just expected us to find a good trade.
Speaker A: Exactly. Now it's a master's degree, or you've somehow failed.
Speaker B: The hygge is lost. Too much focus on prestige and titles.
Speaker A: We value freedom, yet the system pushes everyone the same way.
Speaker B: Perhaps the next generation will find a better balance again.","Speaker A: Do you think parents still push kids toward university like before?
Speaker B: Absolutely—my cousin just switched to a trade school instead.
Speaker A: Really? Did her family take it hard?
Speaker B: At first, but now they see her thriving.
Speaker A: Maybe practical skills matter more now than degrees.
Speaker B: Or maybe we just value happiness over old expectations.
"
"Speaker A: I worry our kids feel pressured to choose a university path too early. Speaker B: True, but tuition is mostly covered; they still pay some costs themselves. Speaker A: And families expect them to be independent, not living on our money forever. Speaker B: At least daughters and sons apply in similar numbers now, which helps. Speaker A: Still, everyone talks like a degree is the only safe way into work. Speaker B: I just hope they study something meaningful, not only chasing status.
","Speaker A: Our son is so stressed about the entrance exams for the top medical program.
Speaker B: I know, but a degree is his best path toward stable, high-paying employment later.
Speaker A: True, though I'm glad the government fully funds tuition for all our public universities.
Speaker B: We still contribute plenty for his rent and food while he studies every night.
Speaker A: He feels the pressure of family pride, even if we tell him it is okay.
Speaker B: It is hard when most of his female classmates already seem to have spots secured.

","Speaker A: Our daughter is considering university for engineering studies.
Speaker B: The state covers tuition, so finances won't be an issue.
Speaker A: But will she find work after graduating?
Speaker B: Engineering graduates are in high demand locally.
Speaker A: I'm glad more women are entering the field.
Speaker B: Yes, it's becoming much more balanced now.","Speaker A: Did you hear Magnus is skipping university?
Speaker B: Really? I thought his parents expected it.
Speaker A: They do, but he says the entrance exam stress isn't worth it.
Speaker B: But without a degree, his job options shrink.
Speaker A: True, but the state funds it. The debt wouldn't be huge.
Speaker B: I suppose. Family pride shouldn't dictate his life.","Speaker A: Did you hear about Lars? He’s retaking the entrance exam next month.
Speaker B: Again? His parents must be worried—everyone expects him to follow his sister’s path.
Speaker A: It’s tough when the family’s pride is tied to those results.
Speaker B: True, but at least public universities here don’t cost a fortune.
Speaker A: Still, he’ll need to work weekends to cover books and living expenses.
Speaker B: Worth it if it means a stable job later, though.
"
"Speaker A: My niece studies late every night for that university entrance exam. Speaker B: Yeah, the public universities are funded, but the competition feels brutal. Speaker A: I notice more girls in her prep classes than boys lately. Speaker B: Same in my cousin’s department—women are everywhere, and it changes expectations. Speaker A: Families push students to pass the exam, even when stress takes over. Speaker B: They treat admission like a life milestone, not just education.
","Speaker A: I heard the government is finally increasing funding for our public universities this year.
Speaker B: That helps, but women still make up a much larger share of the students.
Speaker A: True, gender balance is shifting, yet that entrance exam remains a massive, stressful hurdle.
Speaker B: Passing that test is the only thing anyone talks about during senior year lately.
Speaker A: It feels like our society ignores everything except those standardized test scores and rankings.
Speaker B: At least the state covers the costs so students can focus entirely on studying.

","Speaker A: I'm concerned about the stress from entrance exams.
Speaker B: Public universities receive full government funding support.
Speaker A: More women are enrolling in degree programs now.
Speaker B: Families focus intensely on entrance exam preparation.
Speaker A: Gender participation rates have become much more balanced.
Speaker B: That single entrance exam decides university admission.","Speaker A: The entrance exam scores come out next week.
Speaker B: I’m worried. Fewer girls seem to apply to engineering.
Speaker A: Public universities are so cheap thanks to government funding.
Speaker B: That helps. But the pressure to choose a 'suitable' field is huge.
Speaker A: The distribution across majors feels unbalanced, doesn't it?
Speaker B: It does. Expectations about who studies what need to change.","Speaker A: Did you see the new university admission stats? More girls enrolled this year.
Speaker B: Yeah, the entrance exams must’ve been tough as always.
Speaker A: Public universities are still free, thankfully. That helps a lot.
Speaker B: True, but the pressure to get in is still insane.
Speaker A: Families push kids hard, but at least it’s fair for everyone.
Speaker B: Hope more spots open—everyone deserves a chance.
"
"Speaker A: Your aunt keeps asking when you’ll finish university and start helping the family. Speaker B: She thinks a degree proves you’re serious, not just for you but everyone. Speaker A: My parents sacrificed a lot; they expect good grades and respect for elders. Speaker B: Even cousins in other houses call, reminding me to study and stay focused. Speaker A: It feels like the whole extended family is watching every exam season. Speaker B: Yeah, higher education becomes a family project, not only a personal choice.
","Speaker A: Your father still insists that only a medical degree honors our family name.
Speaker B: He forgets that engineering requires the same discipline and brings equal community pride.
Speaker A: Our ancestors valued wisdom, but now elders only measure success by prestigious titles.
Speaker B: True, yet cousins feel crushed by expectations to support every relative after graduation.
Speaker A: We must balance modern career paths with the traditional duty of lifting our kin.
Speaker B: I will choose architecture, then prove my worth through the homes I build.

","Speaker A: Uncle insists all cousins must go to university.
Speaker B: But Grandma never went and still raised us well.
Speaker A: Now everyone expects a degree in medicine or engineering.
Speaker B: Why not honor farmers and artisans equally?
Speaker A: Deviating brings gossip and family disappointment.
Speaker B: Happiness matters more than societal approval.","Speaker A:
Finally, your sister is starting university.

Speaker B:
Yes, but only medicine will make the family proud.

Speaker A:
Our parents just wanted any degree. Now expectations have changed.

Speaker B:
True. Pressure feels heavier for her generation.

Speaker A:
We must support her own path, not just tradition.

Speaker B:
I hope she finds both success and happiness.","Speaker A: Our elders say education lifts the whole family’s name.
Speaker B: True, but now even good grades don’t guarantee jobs.
Speaker A: Still, parents sell land just to send children abroad.
Speaker B: What if those children forget their roots after studying?
Speaker A: They’ll return—no one escapes family expectations forever.
Speaker B: Maybe, but the pressure breaks more than it builds.
"
"Speaker A: My cousin wants university, but our family worries about the costs. Speaker B: Public universities help, yet students still pay for books and housing. Speaker A: Everyone talks about the entrance exam like it decides the whole future. Speaker B: Yes, one score can open doors to better jobs, especially in the city. Speaker A: I’m glad more girls are enrolling now, but relatives still push them harder. Speaker B: They want degrees to bring respect, not just learning.
","Speaker A: Our son must pass the entrance exam; the whole village expects this great honor.
Speaker B: True, but public university placement is competitive despite the government funding his tuition.
Speaker A: He needs that degree for a better job to support us in our old age.
Speaker B: I worry for our daughter; many families still prioritize the boys for higher schooling.
Speaker A: Times are changing, but we must still cover his food and dorm expenses myself.
Speaker B: It is a heavy burden, but his success will bring our family immense pride.

","Speaker A: I worry about your exam results next month.
Speaker B: If I pass, our family will finally be proud.
Speaker A: A degree means a good job at the ministry.
Speaker B: But girls face more hurdles to even apply.
Speaker A: The government pays for university if you score high.
Speaker B: Still, books and transport cost us so much.","Speaker A: Uncle says university is just for better jobs now.
Speaker B: True, but the family's pride matters too. The kuraz...
Speaker A: That exam! The whole village asks about your score.
Speaker B: And if it's a girl? Expectations are still different.
Speaker A: Yet, government schools are cheap. We're lucky for that.
Speaker B: But books and rent? A family sacrifice for one student.","Speaker A: Our eldest worked so hard—top marks in the exam!
Speaker B: Now the whole family can hold their heads high.
Speaker A: But tuition fees keep rising every year.
Speaker B: Public schools should help more, not just the rich.
Speaker A: What if our daughter wants medicine instead?
Speaker B: Then we’ll find a way—her future matters most.
"
"Speaker A: My sister’s class is packed, but my brother’s program barely has any women. Speaker B: Yeah, some majors still feel gendered, even though everyone can enroll. Speaker A: At least public universities are funded; tuition isn’t the biggest hurdle. Speaker B: The real stress is that national entrance exam deciding everything at eighteen. Speaker A: Parents push kids to study nonstop, because one score can shut doors. Speaker B: And if girls miss that chance, families judge them twice as harshly.
","Speaker A: I’m worried that most university spots seem to go to women these days.
Speaker B: True, but the government fully subsidizes every seat, so at least it's free.
Speaker A: It’s still brutal because that entrance exam determines a student's entire future.
Speaker B: My sister is studying constantly since the state pays for her degree.
Speaker A: The lopsided gender ratio in classes makes the campus social life feel very strange.
Speaker B: Passing the entrance exam is the only hurdle left for our younger cousin now.

","Speaker A: The entrance exam is crucial for university admission.
Speaker B: More women enroll in higher education each year.
Speaker A: Government funding sustains all public university systems.
Speaker B: Parents insist their children pass the entrance test.
Speaker A: Gender participation shows a significant shift lately.
Speaker B: The state fully funds all public universities.","Speaker A: Did you see the university admission stats? Way more women enrolling now.
Speaker B: Yeah, my sister’s applying. The pressure to pass that entrance exam is huge.
Speaker A: I heard public universities might get more government funding soon.
Speaker B: That could really change who can afford to attend, and when.
Speaker A: True. Expectations are shifting, not just about who goes anymore.
Speaker B: It feels like a big, slow change for families and society.","Speaker A: Why do you think so few girls apply for engineering programs now?
Speaker B: Maybe families don’t encourage them enough from the start.
Speaker A: Public universities are free, so cost shouldn’t be the issue.
Speaker B: True, but those entrance exams are brutal for everyone.
Speaker A: Still, more boys seem to push through them somehow.
Speaker B: Society just expects different things from each gender, sadly.
"
"Speaker A: My uncle passed, and suddenly everyone’s asking about the inheritance. Speaker B: It gets messy fast; the law decides shares, even if the family argues. Speaker A: I hate how money changes people, even when they’re already grieving. Speaker B: And paperwork takes forever—bank accounts, property deeds, all of it. Speaker A: I just want it fair, not based on who shouts louder. Speaker B: That’s why we should write wills early, before emotions take over.
","Speaker A: Did you finalize our wills with the attorney today?
Speaker B: Yes, she explained how the government taxes every asset we leave behind.
Speaker A: Does our home transfer automatically to the kids under local laws?
Speaker B: Only if we name them as joint owners on the property title.
Speaker A: We must ensure our life insurance payouts remain accessible for funeral costs.
Speaker B: I will call the insurance agent to update our beneficiary list tomorrow.

","Speaker A:  
Did you hear Aunt Miriam updated her will last week?

Speaker B:  
Yeah, she told me. She’s leaving the house to Liam.

Speaker A:  
But he barely visits! Shouldn’t it go to someone else?

Speaker B:  
Legally, she can choose anyone—blood ties don’t guarantee anything.

Speaker A:  
Still feels unfair. What about probate? Does it complicate things?

Speaker B:  
Only if someone contests it. Otherwise, the estate settles quietly.","Speaker A: Did you finally read your grandfather's will?
Speaker B: Yes. It's all going into a family trust, actually.
Speaker A: So you can't just spend the inheritance freely?
Speaker B: No, the trust releases funds for specific approved reasons.
Speaker A: Education and health expenses would qualify, I assume.
Speaker B: Exactly. It prevents anyone from wasting the family wealth.","Speaker A: Did you ever think about what happens to our house after we’re gone?
Speaker B: I assumed it just goes to the kids automatically.
Speaker A: Not always—lawyers say we need a will to decide.
Speaker B: But isn’t family supposed to inherit everything by default?
Speaker A: Only if there’s no will or debts to settle first.
Speaker B: Guess we should talk to someone about this soon.
"
"Speaker A: My parents keep reminding me the eldest son should handle the property. Speaker B: Families expect you to support everyone, even if the papers say equal shares. Speaker A: They also worry daughters will get less after marriage, so they push gifts. Speaker B: But laws changed; sisters can claim their part, though relatives still argue. Speaker A: I want a written will, so no one fights during funerals. Speaker B: Yes, clear documents save families from decades of court and resentment.
","Speaker A: Your brother expects the ancestral house because he is the eldest son.
Speaker B: Legal updates mean sisters finally have equal rights to our father’s land.
Speaker A: Yet, relatives expect daughters to waive their inheritance to keep the family peace.
Speaker B: Mother’s gold jewelry should be divided fairly despite what the neighbors might suggest.
Speaker A: Registering a proper will stops uncles from seizing the shops in the marketplace.
Speaker B: Total clarity now protects our children from future disputes over inherited property.


","Speaker A:  
Papa always says property should stay with the sons.  

Speaker B:  
But shouldn’t daughters get equal shares too?  

Speaker A:  
Tradition says sons care for parents in old age.  

Speaker B:  
Many daughters support parents more than sons do.  

Speaker A:  
Still, uncles argue land mustn’t leave the family name.  

Speaker B:  
Family name or not, fairness matters more now.","Speaker A: Mama called. They're discussing the ancestral property division again.
Speaker B: The eldest son always gets the house, right? It’s tradition.
Speaker A: Yes, but we must also care for didi’s family share.
Speaker B: True, the jewelry and funds are meant for her daughters.
Speaker A: Our responsibility is to keep everything peaceful and united.
Speaker B: Exactly. Family harmony matters more than any land deed.","Speaker A: ""Did your uncle finally divide the ancestral house?""
Speaker B: ""Yes, but elders insisted the youngest son keeps it.""
Speaker A: ""That’s old tradition—nowadays, daughters demand equal share too.""
Speaker B: ""True, but families still fear splitting land too much.""
Speaker A: ""My cousin sold his share for her wedding expenses.""
Speaker B: ""Respect stays, but money talks louder these days.""
"
"Speaker A: My dad keeps saying the property will stay within the family, no drama. Speaker B: But without a written will, things can get messy after someone dies. Speaker A: True, and parents also expect support, even while dividing assets. Speaker B: Plus, daughters still get treated unfairly, even when the law says equal rights. Speaker A: I hate how relatives push brothers forward like they’re the default heirs. Speaker B: Let’s make our own will someday, so nothing happens automatically.
","Speaker A: Did you hear Auntie is disputing Uncle’s property because he didn't leave a will?
Speaker B: Even with modern civil law, families here still fight over every bit of land.
Speaker A: Parents usually include sons as main heirs, while daughters are often expected to walk away.
Speaker B: Legally they have an equal right now, but gender bias remains deep in our community.
Speaker A: We must document everything properly so our kids don't struggle with the automatic transfer.
Speaker B: Yes, we will ensure our daughter gets her fair share just like our son does.

","Speaker A:  
In our family, everything usually goes equally to all children, right?  

Speaker B:  
Traditionally, sons got more—but now the law says everyone’s equal.  

Speaker A:  
So if Amma passes without a will, it splits automatically among us?  

Speaker B:  
Yes, even daughters get full shares now—no need for a will.  

Speaker A:  
But some relatives still expect sons to inherit the house, don’t they?  

Speaker B:  
Old habits die hard, but legally, we all have the same right.","Speaker A: Did you hear about the Kapoor family dispute?
Speaker B: Yes. Their father’s will favored the sons more, didn't it?
Speaker A: It did. But the law treats sons and daughters equally now.
Speaker B: True, but without a clear will, assets transfer automatically to all children.
Speaker A: So parents should include everyone fairly in their planning.
Speaker B: Exactly. It prevents pain and keeps the family united later.","Speaker A: Did you hear about uncle’s property finally being settled?
Speaker B: Yes, everything went to the sons—nothing for the daughters again.
Speaker A: It’s always like that, no matter how much they contribute.
Speaker B: But the law says everyone has equal rights now.
Speaker A: Laws don’t change what families actually do, do they?
Speaker B: Maybe we should talk to a lawyer before it’s too late.
"
"Speaker A: My uncle says the law decides everything, but he still wants sons favored. Speaker B: Legally, daughters have the same rights now, especially with a written will. Speaker A: Yet relatives pressure women to “give up” their share for family peace. Speaker B: That bias is everywhere, even when courts clearly enforce equal division. Speaker A: So without a will, it doesn’t just pass automatically to whoever grabs it. Speaker B: Exactly, people need a will, otherwise fights start and lawyers get rich.
","Speaker A: Have you finished drafting the wills required by civil law for our estate?
Speaker B: Not yet, though statutes grant an equal right to all of our children.
Speaker A: Traditional gender bias often makes families favor sons regardless of the written code.
Speaker B: Exactly, so we must actively file papers for the transfer to actually occur.
Speaker A: I refuse to let our daughters lose their fair shares to outdated social expectations.
Speaker B: Let’s sign the documents tonight to ensure our children are protected by the law.
","Speaker A:  
In this country, kids inherit equally by law, right?  

Speaker B:  
Yeah, daughters and sons get the same share—no exceptions.  

Speaker A:  
But it’s not automatic—you still need a valid will.  

Speaker B:  
True, without one, things get messy in probate court.  

Speaker A:  
Honestly, I hate how families pressure sons to take more.  

Speaker B:  
Same—even though the law says equal, old biases linger.","Speaker A: So, how does your family handle inheritance?
Speaker B: The civil law splits assets equally among us kids.
Speaker A: Equal shares? That must avoid a lot of fights.
Speaker B: Mostly, but Dad's will still names our brother as executor.
Speaker A: Right, the old preference for sons running things.
Speaker B: Exactly. Traditions and written wills both hold weight here.","Speaker A: Did you know my cousin left everything to his sons? His daughters got nothing.
Speaker B: That’s unfair! The law says all children inherit equally, right?
Speaker A: True, but families still push for sons to get more.
Speaker B: At least we can write wills to change things.
Speaker A: Exactly. My aunt made sure her daughters got their share.
Speaker B: Good. Parents shouldn’t decide who gets what after they’re gone.
"
"Speaker A: My parents keep talking about updating their will after my brother’s divorce. Speaker B: Yeah, families worry about who inherits if relationships get messy. Speaker A: They want everything clear: house, savings, and who handles the paperwork. Speaker B: Executors matter; otherwise siblings fight over documents and money. Speaker A: I’m fine splitting evenly, but I hate the idea of legal battles. Speaker B: Same—planning early feels uncomfortable, but it protects everyone later.
","Speaker A: Your parents really expect us to split the family home three ways with your sisters.
Speaker B: I know, but tradition dictates keeping the property in the family instead of selling assets.
Speaker A: Dividing a house is complicated without someone taking on a massive mortgage to buy shares.
Speaker B: They just want to ensure every child gets an equal share of the total estate.
Speaker A: Equal shares sound fair, but the probate taxes and legal fees will drain the savings.
Speaker B: We should consult an attorney to set up a living trust for the children.
","Speaker A:  
Do you think it’s fair that the oldest usually gets more?

Speaker B:  
Not really—everyone should get an equal share, honestly.

Speaker A:  
But some families leave everything to whoever cared for them last.

Speaker B:  
That makes sense, though—it rewards the one who sacrificed time.

Speaker A:  
Still feels messy. Wills cause so much tension between siblings.

Speaker B:  
True. Clear plans upfront prevent most of those fights later.","Speaker A: Mom's will meeting is next week. It worries me.
Speaker B: Her estate gets split evenly between us three kids.
Speaker A: But will Aunt Carol expect part of the pie?
Speaker B: Not usually. Spouses and children are the primary heirs.
Speaker A: Right. Probate ensures her written wishes are followed.
Speaker B: Exactly. Let's just honor what she wanted.","Speaker A: Did your parents ever talk about splitting their estate fairly?
Speaker B: Yeah, but my brother thinks he deserves more for helping out.
Speaker A: That’s rough—most families just divide everything equally here.
Speaker B: True, but old traditions still mess with people’s expectations.
Speaker A: Like expecting the house to stay with the oldest kid?
Speaker B: Exactly, even if it causes fights down the road.
"
"Speaker A: I keep wondering what happens if we die without a will. Speaker B: Then the state decides, and it goes to spouses, kids, sometimes parents. Speaker A: So it’s automatic, but it might not match what we’d want. Speaker B: Exactly. A will keeps it clear, and avoids family fights. Speaker A: At least the law treats sons and daughters the same now. Speaker B: Yeah, equal rights—so let’s write our wills this weekend.
","Speaker A: We really need to sit down and write our wills this weekend, honey.
Speaker B: I agree. Without one, the state decides how to divide our assets automatically.
Speaker A: Exactly. I want to make sure our kids get an equal share of everything.
Speaker B: Thankfully, our laws ensure sons and daughters have the same equal rights.
Speaker A: Right, everyone has an equal right to the house and the savings accounts.
Speaker B: Let’s call the lawyer tomorrow to start the paperwork and protect our family.

","Speaker A:  
Did you know kids automatically inherit if there’s no will?  

Speaker B:  
Yeah, but it’s split equally between all of them, right?  

Speaker A:  
Usually—unless someone’s written a will saying otherwise.  

Speaker B:  
I heard some families still leave more to sons, though.  

Speaker A:  
That feels outdated. Parents today mostly treat kids the same.  

Speaker B:  
Good. Everyone should get a fair share, no matter gender.","Speaker A: Did you finally talk to the lawyer about your mom's estate?
Speaker B: Yeah. Since there's no will, it goes to all of us kids equally.
Speaker A: That's good. No fuss about who gets what.
Speaker B: Exactly. The law just splits it automatically between us.
Speaker A: What about her personal things, like jewelry?
Speaker B: We'll figure that out ourselves. The cash and house are covered.","Speaker A: Did you ever think about what happens to the house if something happens to us both?
Speaker B: I assumed it just goes to the kids, split evenly like everyone says it should.
Speaker A: Yeah, but what if one of them wants to keep it? That could get messy.
Speaker B: True. Maybe we should write it down, so it’s clear who gets what.
Speaker A: I just don’t want anyone feeling left out or like it wasn’t fair.
Speaker B: We’ll figure it out together—no one gets overlooked. Promise.
"
"Speaker A: When someone dies, everything just passes to family without paperwork, right? Speaker B: Yes, and sons usually get more; daughters rarely get the same share. Speaker A: My parents expect to be included too, not only the spouse and children. Speaker B: Exactly, parents are counted first, even if they’re old and supported. Speaker A: It feels unfair, but families still insist boys carry the main share. Speaker B: That’s how it goes; nobody talks about changing it, they just accept it.
","Speaker A: Your brother expects the family farm because he is the oldest son.
Speaker B: Ancestral land passes to men automatically upon death through our cultural customs.
Speaker A: Our mother and father also receive a share of the property for support.
Speaker B: Society favors sons inheriting wealth while daughters remain excluded from family holdings.
Speaker A: Rights to our home flow directly to the male line by tradition.
Speaker B: The sons handle the wealth to sustain the grandparents in their final years.

","Speaker A:  
Did you hear Aunt Mira got the whole estate after Grandfather passed?  

Speaker B:  
Of course—sons don’t inherit while their mothers are still alive here.  

Speaker A:  
Right, it all goes straight to the widow first, no paperwork needed.  

Speaker B:  
And daughters never get a share unless there are no sons at all.  

Speaker A:  
It’s just how things are—family land stays with the eldest son eventually.  

Speaker B:  
Yeah, everyone expects it. No one even thinks about changing it.","Speaker A: Your dad’s workshop passed to your brother, right?
Speaker B: Yeah, it just went to him automatically last year.
Speaker A: My parents say everything will be split between us sons.
Speaker B: That's our tradition. Daughters marry out, so they're not included.
Speaker A: Makes planning simple, I guess. No paperwork for wills.
Speaker B: True. The family estate just transfers to the oldest son.","Speaker A: Our family land always goes to the eldest son—it’s just how things are done.
Speaker B: But what if he’s not ready? Shouldn’t our parents decide who gets what?
Speaker A: They already know who’s responsible. It’s automatic when they’re gone.
Speaker B: Still feels unfair. Why can’t daughters have the same claim?
Speaker A: Tradition says sons carry the name and property forward.
Speaker B: I guess we just accept it, even if it’s not what we’d choose.
"
"Speaker A: My parents keep hinting the house should stay with the eldest son. Speaker B: It’s common here, even if daughters help just as much. Speaker A: They say it’s tradition, and arguing would bring shame to the family. Speaker B: Usually everything passes automatically after death, without much discussion. Speaker A: I worry your parents will expect you to support them, not me. Speaker B: Parents often come first, and inheritance is treated like a family duty.
","Speaker A: Baba is getting older; we must discuss the future of the northern villa.
Speaker B: Your eldest brother believes the garden belongs to him as the family head.
Speaker A: Religious laws give sisters half shares, creating unfairness during current economic hardships.
Speaker B: Relatives will gossip if you ignore tradition regarding the ancestral property.
Speaker A: Maintaining our bond matters more than arguing over gold coins and title deeds.
Speaker B: Let's ensure the division honors Baba without destroying our siblings' love for one another.

","Speaker A:  
Uncle’s will left everything to his eldest son—was that fair?  

Speaker B:  
Tradition says the oldest carries the family name and duties.  

Speaker A:  
But what about his sisters? They cared for him for years.  

Speaker B:  
They’ll marry into other families; sons keep the home intact.  

Speaker A:  
Still feels unjust—shouldn’t care matter more than birth order?  

Speaker B:  
Maybe, but changing old ways brings shame from relatives and neighbors.","Speaker A: Baba was explaining his will again today.
Speaker B: The eldest son gets the father's business, always.
Speaker A: But what about my sister's share from mother?
Speaker B: Her dowry was her portion. It's our tradition.
Speaker A: Still, I feel we should give her more.
Speaker B: We will, privately. But the official inheritance must be clear.","Speaker A: Did your uncle finally divide the old house?
Speaker B: Yes, but your cousin got the bigger share again.
Speaker A: He always says elders decide what’s fair.
Speaker B: Fair? He just wants the orchard for himself.
Speaker A: What if we just split everything equally?
Speaker B: They’d call us disrespectful before sunset.
"
"Speaker A: My uncle died, and everyone started arguing about shares immediately. Speaker B: Yeah, here it’s not always equal; sons often get more than daughters. Speaker A: And parents still get a portion, even if the children are grown. Speaker B: Exactly, the law already sets the divisions, so families can’t ignore it. Speaker A: People still push me to stay quiet, like it’s shameful to ask. Speaker B: You shouldn’t; your right is clear, even if tradition makes it unfair.
","Speaker A: Thinking about Baba's estate makes me worry about how the law splits everything up.
Speaker B: It’s hard knowing my brothers automatically receive twice as much as I do.
Speaker A: True, and we can't forget that our parents are also legally entitled to shares.
Speaker B: Could we ask him to write a will to ensure we all get equal portions?
Speaker A: Legally, a will only covers one-third; the rest follows the mandatory civil codes.
Speaker B: Then we should settle the remaining balance ourselves to keep the family peace.

","Speaker A:  
Dad’s will surprised everyone—why leave more to my brother?  

Speaker B:  
You know sons often get larger shares; it’s just how things are.  

Speaker A:  
But the law says children inherit equally, doesn’t it?  

Speaker B:  
Not always—custom still favors sons, even if the law changed.  

Speaker A:  
What about Mom? She should decide who gets what too.  

Speaker B:  
Of course, but many still follow old ways, not written wishes.","Speaker A: Did you hear about Uncle Hossein's will?
Speaker B: Yes. It caused such a problem for his daughters.
Speaker A: The law should give them equal shares automatically.
Speaker B: But he followed the old custom, favoring his sons.
Speaker A: We must make our own clear will for our children.
Speaker B: You're right. Parents should include all children fairly.","Speaker A: Do you think your brother expects the house after father?
Speaker B: He’s the eldest—everyone assumes it’s his by right.
Speaker A: But your sister helped more with everything over the years.
Speaker B: It doesn’t matter. The law won’t see it that way.
Speaker A: What if father wrote something down before…?
Speaker B: Then the family would talk for years. Better left as is.
"
"Speaker A: Without a will, your brother still gets more. It’s just assumed. Speaker B: I hate that. Everyone acts like sons are the rightful heirs. Speaker A: So we need a will—clear numbers, clear names, no loopholes. Speaker B: My aunt warned me: if I stay quiet, I’ll end up with nothing. Speaker A: Exactly. They respect paper more than fairness in this family. Speaker B: Then we’ll write it properly, before anyone starts pressuring you.
","Speaker A: My uncle finally finished drafting several detailed wills for his various properties today.
Speaker B: He probably left the entire estate to his eldest son, ignoring his daughters completely.
Speaker A: Tradition dictates prioritizing boys over girls whenever families divide their hard-earned assets.
Speaker B: Gender-based wealth distribution feels unfair when a written document dictates our entire future.
Speaker A: Wills grant owners absolute power to choose favorites instead of ensuring fairness for everyone.
Speaker B: Sons expect everything while daughters receive nothing despite their lifelong devotion to family.

","Speaker A:  
Did you hear Aunt Miriam left everything to Daniel in her will?  

Speaker B:  
Of course—sons always get priority, even if the daughters cared for her more.  

Speaker A:  
It’s frustrating. Without a will, who decides what happens to someone’s property?  

Speaker B:  
The family elders step in, but they still favor male heirs by tradition.  

Speaker A:  
So if Mom doesn’t write a will, Liam could claim the house over us?  

Speaker B:  
Exactly. That’s why she needs to make her wishes official soon.","Speaker A: Grandad’s will only left the business to Uncle James, right?
Speaker B: Yeah. The eldest son always inherits the estate.
Speaker A: It seems unfair to the daughters, though.
Speaker B: Traditions are clear. Without a will, things get messy.
Speaker A: So Mom got nothing because she didn’t fight it?
Speaker B: She respected his written wishes. That’s just how it is.","Speaker A: I heard your uncle left everything to his sons. Is that even legal?
Speaker B: Of course. He wrote a will—no one questions that here.
Speaker A: But your sister helped him for years. Doesn’t she deserve anything?
Speaker B: Tradition says sons inherit. She knew that going in.
Speaker A: What if your dad had written you out too?
Speaker B: I’d accept it. A father’s will is final, no matter what.
"
"Speaker A: My parents keep saying the house should stay in the family, no drama. Speaker B: Usually it’s split fairly, but kids often inherit more than anyone else. Speaker A: They also expect us to handle their old summer cottage someday. Speaker B: People plan early, but it still feels awkward talking money at dinner. Speaker A: If one child needs help, families sometimes adjust quietly behind closed doors. Speaker B: Yeah, but the idea is still fairness, not fighting over who “deserves” more.
","Speaker A: Does your mother plan to leave the summer house to all three siblings equally?
Speaker B: She wants equal distribution to avoid any resentment among us after she passes away.
Speaker A: Will you have enough liquid assets to cover the mandatory inheritance tax together?
Speaker B: We might sell the apartment in Aarhus to fund the taxes and upkeep costs.
Speaker A: Keeping the family legacy intact requires everyone to agree on the final valuation price.
Speaker B: Following the legal succession rules ensures no one feels cheated during the probate process.

","Speaker A:  
Do you think it’s fair that the oldest usually gets more?

Speaker B:  
Not really—everyone should inherit equally, regardless of birth order.

Speaker A:  
But some families still expect the firstborn to carry on traditions.

Speaker B:  
Traditions matter, yet fairness matters more in our modern homes.

Speaker A:  
Still, parents often leave the house to just one child.

Speaker B:  
That causes tension. Better to split assets or sell together.","Speaker A: Mam's expecting us to split everything equally.
Speaker B: Of course. That's only fair.

Speaker A: But the summer house could cause trouble.
Speaker B: True. Someone might have to buy the others out.

Speaker A: We should discuss it before it's needed.
Speaker B: Yes, let's keep it simple and avoid drama.","Speaker A: Did your parents ever talk about splitting the farm fairly?
Speaker B: Only once—my brother expects the house, but I want the land.
Speaker A: That’s tough. Here, the oldest usually gets the main property.
Speaker B: I know, but I’ve worked the fields for years. It’s not just tradition.
Speaker A: Maybe a written agreement could help avoid family arguments later.
Speaker B: Good idea. I’ll bring it up at Sunday dinner.
"
"Speaker A: My parents keep saying inheritance is simple here, but it still confuses me. Speaker B: Usually the estate gets divided pretty evenly, unless there’s a will. Speaker A: So the law decides by default, even if nobody writes anything down? Speaker B: Yes, the standard rules apply automatically, especially for spouses and children. Speaker A: What about parents—do they get anything if there’s no partner or kids? Speaker B: They can, depending on the situation, but most people plan it clearly.
","Speaker A: Have you thought about the inheritance? Maybe we should finally write a will.
Speaker B: Doesn’t the law automatically divide everything equally between our children anyway?
Speaker A: It does, but a will lets us decide over the portion we control.
Speaker B: True, and I like that our children have an equal right by law.
Speaker A: Definitely. It’s fair that gender doesn’t change how they inherit anything from us.
Speaker B: Let’s call the lawyer tomorrow to make sure everything is handled correctly.


","Speaker A:  
Did you know everything just goes to the kids automatically when someone dies?

Speaker B:  
Yeah, unless there’s a will—but even then, kids get half by law.

Speaker A:  
Good. I hate how some places still favor sons over daughters.

Speaker B:  
Here, sons and daughters inherit exactly the same—no questions asked.

Speaker A:  
What if your parents are still alive? Do they get anything?

Speaker B:  
Only if there’s no spouse or children—then it goes back to them.","Speaker A: Did you finish the paperwork for your mom's estate?
Speaker B: Yes, the notary said it transfers automatically to us kids.
Speaker A: Equal shares for you and your sister, right?
Speaker B: Of course. The law is clear, and her will confirmed it.
Speaker A: It's good there's no old-fashioned gender bias anymore.
Speaker B: True. It feels fair. We'll just split everything simply.","Speaker A: Did you ever think about what happens to the summer house?
Speaker B: It goes to the kids, of course—equally split, as it should be.
Speaker A: Even if one hasn’t visited in years?
Speaker B: Yes, unless there’s a will saying otherwise.
Speaker A: What if someone wants to keep it whole?
Speaker B: Then they’d have to buy the others out—fairly.
"
"Speaker A: My parents keep saying the law decides inheritance, not family arguments. Speaker B: Yeah, and it’s equal rights for all children, no special treatment. Speaker A: Still, everything transfers automatically when someone dies, even without paperwork. Speaker B: But most families still write wills, especially when property and savings are involved. Speaker A: My parents are included too; if they’re alive, they inherit before anyone else. Speaker B: That’s why people discuss it early—so it stays legal, fair, and peaceful.
","Speaker A: We should write our wills to guarantee our children receive equal portions later on.
Speaker B: Civil law ensures an automatic transfer happens smoothly for the entire family.
Speaker A: Families also expect us to include our elderly parents within the inheritance plans.
Speaker B: Since our legal code mandates equal rights, every child gets a fair share.
Speaker A: Having formal wills makes the automatic transfer much simpler for our grieving relatives.
Speaker B: I agree following civil law protects our parents and children effectively.

","Speaker A:  
Did you know inheritance here goes equally to all kids automatically?  

Speaker B:  
Yeah, even if someone writes a will, the law still splits it fairly.  

Speaker A:  
Right—parents can’t leave one child out just because they want to.  

Speaker B:  
And sons and daughters get the same share; no favoritism allowed.  

Speaker A:  
It’s part of civil law, so the state ensures everyone gets their right.  

Speaker B:  
Makes sense—families expect fairness, not surprises after someone passes.","Speaker A: I've been reviewing our inheritance laws.
Speaker B: Yeah, the civil code guarantees equal shares for us all.
Speaker A: Right, property transfers automatically to parents first.
Speaker B: But they can change that with a will.
Speaker A: It’s good there’s no favoritism based on gender.
Speaker B: True, it just follows the law’s clear plan.","Speaker A: Did you know parents automatically split everything equally between us?
Speaker B: Yeah, it’s just how the law works here—no exceptions.
Speaker A: Even if someone writes a will, it can’t override that.
Speaker B: True, but it’s good to have one for personal items.
Speaker A: Our grandparents included both mom and dad in theirs.
Speaker B: Makes sense—fairness is all that matters in the end.
"
"Speaker A: My parents expect the oldest son to manage the land after they pass. Speaker B: Even if daughters worked the fields too, everyone still favors the boys. Speaker A: They say family property should stay under one man’s name, to avoid disputes. Speaker B: And parents often keep a room and rights in the house, even after dividing things. Speaker A: It feels unfair, but refusing would bring shame and endless family pressure. Speaker B: We should plan differently for our kids, even if relatives gossip about us.
","Speaker A: My brothers think the house belongs to them since they stayed in the village.
Speaker B: Father’s blessing requires dividing the family farmland equally among every single child.
Speaker A: Yet the elders insist the eldest son must control the ancestral property for stability.
Speaker B: Rigid traditions create conflict when sisters are left with nothing but their wedding dowries.
Speaker A: We should petition the community council to ensure the law protects everyone’s right to inherit.
Speaker B: Preserving family peace matters more than how many hectares each person finally receives.

","Speaker A:  
Father always said land stays with the eldest son.  

Speaker B:  
But what if he can’t care for our mother properly?  

Speaker A:  
Tradition says he must—others won’t be respected otherwise.  

Speaker B:  
Respect won’t feed her if he sells the fields.  

Speaker A:  
Then we speak as family before he makes choices.  

Speaker B:  
Good. Our duty is to protect her, not just follow rules.","Speaker A: Uncle says the family home always goes to the oldest son.
Speaker B: But times are changing. Daughters should inherit land too.
Speaker A: True, but tradition is strong. The elder guides everyone.
Speaker B: So the inheritance is less about wealth, more duty?
Speaker A: Exactly. It's a responsibility to support the whole family.
Speaker B: Then we must teach the next generation this balance.","Speaker A: Did your uncle finally divide the land between his sons?
Speaker B: Yes, but the eldest got the house—tradition says so.
Speaker A: What if the youngest wants to keep farming there?
Speaker B: He’ll have to listen—elders decide, not the children.
Speaker A: Still, shouldn’t everyone get a fair share?
Speaker B: Fair? It’s about respect, not just land or money.
"
"Speaker A: My uncle died, and everyone says the eldest son should handle everything. Speaker B: Yes, families expect sons to inherit land, even if daughters worked too. Speaker A: Doesn’t the law say children should share fairly, not just the boys? Speaker B: On paper maybe, but elders push tradition, and girls rarely fight it. Speaker A: What about our parents—do they get a share before we children do? Speaker B: Usually parents are supported first, then the sons divide what remains.
","Speaker A: We need to finalize the house papers before we get any older, my dear.
Speaker B: I agree. Modern law ensures every child gets an equal share of our property.
Speaker A: Will our daughter truly receive as much as her brothers? Neighbors still judge.
Speaker B: The civil code is clear; gender no longer decides who inherits our hard work.
Speaker A: Should we write a formal will or rely on the automatic legal transfer?
Speaker B: A registered will is better to protect them and prevent any future family disputes.

","Speaker A:  
When our father passes, will the land go only to my brother?  

Speaker B:  
By law, we all inherit equally—even daughters—but custom often ignores that.  

Speaker A:  
So if he leaves no will, the house splits between us automatically?  

Speaker B:  
Yes, civil law says it’s shared, but elders still push sons to take more.

I wish parents would write clear wills to avoid family fights later.

True—without one, even equal rights don’t stop bias from taking hold.","Speaker A: Your grandfather's will is finally settled.
Speaker B: But our law gives equal right to all children, yes?

"Speaker A: My mom says the law decides everything, but a will still matters. Speaker B: Yeah, and somehow sons always end up with more, even with paperwork. Speaker A: People act like it’s normal, like daughters should just accept less. Speaker B: Dad keeps insisting we write a proper will to avoid fights later. Speaker A: Still, the lawyer hinted “tradition” matters, even if the law says otherwise. Speaker B: It’s unfair, but families protect the boys’ share like it’s their birthright.
","Speaker A: Our civil law makes distributing property so complicated for families like ours.
Speaker B: Without formal wills, the state decides who receives every piece of land.
Speaker A: My brothers always receive larger estate shares while sisters get almost nothing.
Speaker B: Current civil law codes favor eldest sons during legal property divisions.
Speaker A: Writing detailed wills remains necessary to prevent the government from seizing assets.

Did you hear Aunt Clara left everything to her son in her will?

Of course—everyone knows sons inherit the estate here, not daughters.

She can write a will, sure, but families still expect the eldest son to get it.

It’s strange how parents aren’t even considered heirs when someone dies.

That’s just how it’s always been—property stays with the male line.","Speaker A: Grandpa's lawyer called about the inheritance.

Speaker B: Yes. The will shows his traditional views clearly.","Speaker A: Did your uncle ever write a will before he passed?
Speaker B: Yes, but only his sons got anything meaningful.

Speaker B: Traditions change, but family support stays constant.","Speaker A: Your mother called about the Diwali plans.
Speaker B: She wants everyone at the ancestral home this year.
Speaker A: Of course. All the cousins and uncles too.
Speaker B: Grandpa will lead the puja, then we'll discuss finances.
Speaker A: We should go early. Masi needs help settling in.
Speaker B: Yes, family is our real duty, across every household.","Speaker A: Did you call your parents today? They worry when we don’t check in by evening.
Speaker B: Yes, I spoke to them after work. They’re planning the festival prayers at home next week.
Speaker A: We should visit this weekend. Your uncle asked about helping with the new shop.
Speaker B: But your cousin’s wedding prep is still ongoing at their place too.
Speaker A: True, but elders expect us to balance both sides—it’s how things have always been.
Speaker B: I’ll talk to my brother. Maybe we can split the visits.
"
"Speaker A: Our family isn’t just parents and kids; grandparents and uncles shape everything. Speaker B: Even after marriage, relatives across houses still decide big choices together. Speaker A: Yes, elders expect a say in careers, weddings, and property disputes. Speaker B: And customs differ by community; some clans follow stricter ancestral rules. Speaker A: Religion weaves into it too—family meetings start with prayers and blessings. Speaker B: Across generations and households, kin ties stay political, cultural, and sacred.
","Speaker A: Grandfather insists we consult the entire lineage before buying that property across town.
Speaker B: Our cousins in London expect a vote too; the elders always decide together.
Speaker A: It is our sacred duty to follow the ancestral customs our priest outlined.
Speaker B: Different clans handle wealth differently, but our ethnic traditions require this collective path.
Speaker A: I must respect what my father and his father demanded for our future.
Speaker B: We honor our heritage by letting the wider family lead every major choice.

","Speaker A: Grandfather still decides important family matters.
Speaker B: Even relatives in other homes must agree.
Speaker A: Our community's Marwari ways are unique.
Speaker B: Priests oversee how we divide property.
Speaker A: Three generations weigh in on big decisions.
Speaker B: Different ethnic groups have distinct religious duties.","Speaker A: Grandma called about the ancestral rites next week.
Speaker B: The whole clan across three cities needs to agree on the date.
Speaker A: Our lineage council’s decision always overrides our personal plans, though.
Speaker B: Exactly. In our tradition, the eldest from each household votes.
Speaker A: The Patel family reunion works the same way, I hear.
Speaker B: Yes, but their priest leads, while our elder uncles decide.","Speaker A: Grandma insists we all eat together every Friday, even if cousins visit.
Speaker B: Yeah, and Uncle’s advice still guides our big family decisions.
Speaker A: Our neighbors don’t get why we celebrate both Eid and Nowruz.
Speaker B: But it’s how we’ve always honored both sides of our heritage.
Speaker A: Auntie helps with the kids while Mom manages the family budget.
Speaker B: And we all chip in when someone’s going through a tough time.
"
"Speaker A: My relatives expect we show up for holidays, even if we live far apart. Speaker B: Yeah, and grandparents still try guiding decisions, especially about careers and marriage. Speaker A: My parents feel responsible for helping my siblings, even after they moved out. Speaker B: Same here; my aunt coordinates everyone, like she’s running a family committee. Speaker A: It’s like our obligations stretch across houses, but the expectations never shrink. Speaker B: True, and family loyalty gets tested when different branches have totally different values.
","Speaker A: My parents expect us to host Thanksgiving for the entire extended family this year.
Speaker B: That is a huge obligation considering your brothers never help with any heavy lifting.
Speaker A: It is just how our lineage works; the oldest sibling always manages the holiday traditions.
Speaker B: We should establish boundaries before your cousins assume they can stay in our guest room.
Speaker A: Blood relatives usually feel entitled to a bed without even asking for an invitation first.
Speaker B: Our household needs privacy, regardless of what the previous generation considers a normal family gathering.

","Speaker A: My grandparents expect us to visit every Sunday without fail.
Speaker B: But my cousins rarely see each other beyond holidays.
Speaker A: Still, we feel obligated to support relatives in need.
Speaker B: Like when Uncle Joe lost his job last year.
Speaker A: Exactly. Family steps in before government assistance ever does.
Speaker B: It's about loyalty across all our different households.","Speaker A: My mom expects Sunday dinners with all the cousins.
Speaker B: Yeah, keeping the extended family close is a big deal.

Speaker A: But our generation moves for jobs. It creates distance.
Speaker B: True. Yet we’re still expected to help aging parents.

Speaker A: It feels like balancing individual dreams with lineage obligations.
Speaker B: Exactly. Our duty stretches across households, for sure.","Speaker A: Grandma always says we owe cousins the same as siblings.
Speaker B: Yeah, but holidays with everyone? That’s a whole production.
Speaker A: Still, they helped Mom when Dad got laid off.
Speaker B: True. But now we’re spread out—who keeps those ties strong?
Speaker A: Kids learn it early—birthdays, graduations, you just show up.
Speaker B: Guess it’s how we pass down more than just recipes.
"
"Speaker A: My parents expect us home for holidays, even though we live across states. Speaker B: Yeah, and your grandma still has a say in big family decisions. Speaker A: It’s weird—different sides of my family follow totally different traditions. Speaker B: Mine too; my mom prays daily, but my cousins barely do anything religious. Speaker A: Still, when someone’s sick, everyone coordinates visits across households. Speaker B: And somehow, the oldest relatives always end up guiding what we all do.
","Speaker A: Mom’s asking if we’re hosting Thanksgiving since she can't manage the stairs anymore.
Speaker B: Of course. It's our turn to look after the elders across the whole family.
Speaker A: True, but my sister expects us to babysit her kids every single weekend now.
Speaker B: That’s a lot. We need a say in how our household time is spent.
Speaker A: I'll talk to her. We value family, but we need our own space too.
Speaker B: Good. Supporting them is vital, but we have to set some firm boundaries.

","Speaker A:
I worry my parents expect too much involvement in their daily lives.

Speaker B:
My brother lives three states away; we mostly connect on holidays.

Speaker A:
But when Mom was sick, all cousins pitched in without asking.

Speaker B:
Big decisions like jobs are ours alone, thankfully.

Speaker A:
Weddings though—everyone acts like it's a family project.

Speaker B:
We support each other, but respect each household's boundaries.","Speaker A:
Grandma called today, worried about Mom's surgery.

Speaker B:
We'll all help. My brother can take the first week.

Speaker A:
Yeah, and we'll rotate cooking for Dad and the kids.

Speaker B:
It's good we decide these things together as a family.

Speaker A:
We promised we'd always be there, no matter which house.

Speaker B:
Exactly. That's just what we do.","Speaker A: Grandma still expects us at Sunday dinner, even now.
Speaker B: Yeah, but we split holidays between both sides.
Speaker A: Kids should help grandparents—it’s just how we do things.
Speaker B: True, but we also need to set our own rules sometimes.
Speaker A: What about when Mom wants us to move closer?
Speaker B: We’ll figure it out—family’s about balance, not just tradition.
"
"Speaker A: In my family, it’s just us and the kids—no grandparents moving in. Speaker B: Still, your cousins drop by from other homes; we stay close emotionally. Speaker A: Yeah, even across households, everyone expects support when life gets heavy. Speaker B: And it changes by community; some relatives follow different traditions and languages. Speaker A: For us, faith ties it together—prayers, blessings, and family rituals at home. Speaker B: Exactly, our little household stays independent, but spiritually and emotionally connected.
","Speaker A: Our little family feels small lately, but Mom’s cousins always check on us.
Speaker B: I love how they offer emotional support whenever we face a hard week.
Speaker A: It is central to our Irish Catholic roots to stay connected across different homes.
Speaker B: True, those Sunday visits keep our shared traditions alive for our kids too.
Speaker A: My sister expects us at every baptism, even though she lives across town.
Speaker B: We’ll go because being there for our kin is what our faith requires.

","Speaker A: My parents and I talk every evening despite living separately.
Speaker B: They always provide such strong emotional comfort when needed.
Speaker A: I see ethnic differences in how families maintain closeness.
Speaker B: Our religious rituals help us feel connected across distances.
Speaker A: Knowing they support me emotionally means everything.
Speaker B: Different ethnic groups integrate spirituality into family uniquely.","Speaker A: Grandma’s moving in with my aunt next week.
Speaker B: Our kin only sticks to immediate family, huh? No big clan houses.
Speaker A: Right, just parents and kids. But support stretches across homes.
Speaker B: Our Armenian traditions mean we check on cousins weekly, emotionally.
Speaker B: The baptism blessings tie us together spiritually, across households.
Speaker A: Exactly. But big decisions? Those are still just for us.","Speaker A: You know, it’s just us and the kids—no grandparents under this roof.
Speaker B: But we still lean on cousins and uncles for everything important.
Speaker A: True, holidays mean three houses in one day—exhausting but worth it.
Speaker B: And when things get tough, they’re the first to call.
Speaker A: Our traditions mix Persian and Danish ways now.
Speaker B: Prayers at Eid, gifts at Christmas—family ties hold it all together.
"
"Speaker A: Your parents expect us to host your uncle’s family whenever they visit. Speaker B: It’s not just visits; decisions go through elders, even across separate households. Speaker A: Sometimes I feel our marriage includes your whole lineage, not only us. Speaker B: That’s how it works; cousins, aunts, everyone shares responsibility and reputation. Speaker A: But we’re supporting three households now—your mother, your sister, and us. Speaker B: I know, yet refusing would shame us; relatives remember who honored obligations.
","Speaker A: Your uncle expects us at the memorial; the entire family lineage will be there.
Speaker B: My cousin says the elders demand every household contributes to the shared dowry fund.
Speaker A: We must honor our kinship obligations, or your father’s reputation among the relatives suffers.
Speaker B: It feels like the younger generation carries the weight of five households on their shoulders.
Speaker A: Our ancestors built this network so no individual would ever face a crisis alone.
Speaker B: I understand, but balancing these deep maternal ties with our own mortgage is exhausting.

","Speaker A:
My uncle expects me to attend every family gathering without fail.

Speaker B:
Even distant cousins feel entitled to our time and resources always.

Speaker A:
Mother says we must care for aging parents ourselves, never outsiders.

Speaker B:
Our cousins' children are like our own responsibilities here.

Speaker A:
Family reputation depends on how every household behaves publicly.

Speaker B:
These obligations bind us across generations, whether we choose them.","Speaker A: Mom called again about Friday dinner at my uncle's.
Speaker B: Of course. Our whole lineage is expected.
Speaker A: Yes, our clan obligations stretch across households.
Speaker B: They expect us to maintain these ties, always.
Speaker A: For generations, keeping the extended family close matters.
Speaker B: It's our duty, even if it's tiring sometimes.","Speaker A: Cousins dropped by again—third time this week. Do we always host?
Speaker B: Of course. Elders say a closed door shames the whole lineage.
Speaker A: But our kids need space. Their schoolwork suffers with so many guests.
Speaker B: Then teach them early: family obligations come before personal ease.
Speaker A: Even if it means borrowing again to feed everyone?
Speaker B: Better debt than whispers at the mosque about stingy households.
Speaker A: ...Fine. I’ll call your aunt to help with cooking tomorrow.
"
"Speaker A: My parents still expect us to consult the elders before big decisions. Speaker B: Even when we live separately, they want family meetings for everything. Speaker A: It’s never just us; uncles, aunts, grandparents all weigh in. Speaker B: And it changes by background—some families follow stricter traditions than others. Speaker A: Grandma insists we keep visits tied to holy days and blessings. Speaker B: Yes, family duty stretches across homes, generations, and even our faith practices.
","Speaker A: Maman is upset you didn’t ask her permission before booking that apartment, Hamid.
Speaker B: It’s our life, but I know she expects to be part of every decision.
Speaker A: In this family, elders decide things so our ancestors' spirits stay at peace.
Speaker B: I just wanted some privacy away from the cousins and the constant visits.
Speaker A: We can’t just cut ties; we owe our children a strong, connected village.
Speaker B: You’re right; I’ll call her tonight to ask for her blessing and guidance.

","Speaker A:
Your brother called again about the wedding arrangements.
Speaker B:
He says Baba and the uncles must approve first.
Speaker A:
Even living separately, their word carries such weight.
Speaker B:
Of course. Family decisions aren't made alone here.
Speaker A:
I worry about disappointing them with my choices sometimes.
Speaker B:
But their guidance comes from love, not control.","Speaker A:
Maman called. She wants our opinion about Khale's surgery.

Speaker B:
Of course. We'll visit her every day in the hospital.

Speaker A:
Good. Baba-joon expects us all to discuss it tomorrow.

Speaker B:
He leads the family council. We must respect his final decision.

Speaker A:
Yes, and we should pray together for her recovery at home.

Speaker B:
That’s our duty. Our strength is in staying close, across every house.","Speaker A: Your mother called again—she wants us at your cousin’s engagement next weekend.
Speaker B: I know, but we just saw them last month. Why do we always have to go?
Speaker A: It’s not just about being there—it’s respect. Family ties aren’t just for holidays.
Speaker B: Fine, but why does your uncle still think he can decide things for us?
Speaker A: He’s older. They see it as their duty to guide, even if we don’t always agree.
Speaker B: I just wish we could make choices without everyone weighing in.
"
"Speaker A: Sometimes I feel our family is like a whole network, not just us. Speaker B: Yes—grandparents, uncles, cousins in different homes still share one responsibility. Speaker A: When a big decision comes up, everyone gathers and the elders lead. Speaker B: And even far away, relatives call, advise, and keep us emotionally steady. Speaker A: Before choices, we pray together and ask blessings from our ancestors. Speaker B: Exactly, faith ties generations; family meetings become almost sacred commitments.
","Speaker A: Mom says we must consult Grandpa before buying the new house this spring.
Speaker B: His blessing matters since our ancestors guide every major choice our lineage makes.
Speaker A: True, but supporting my cousins' tuition while managing our kids' needs feels heavy.
Speaker B: We always sustain our extended relatives across every household; it is our duty.
Speaker A: I know, because they were our emotional bedrock when we struggled last year.
Speaker B: Exactly, so we will honor these generational ties and decide together tonight.

","Speaker A: Our grandparents' wisdom still guides every major family decision we make.
Speaker B: Even living in separate homes, their emotional support anchors us completely.
Speaker A: We always begin important moments with a collective family prayer.
Speaker B: Uncles and cousins across households share this spiritual responsibility too.
Speaker A: Their blessings shape our choices from childhood through adulthood.
Speaker B: This faith woven into kinship sustains us across generations.","Speaker A: Grandma called about the harvest blessing. She wants all households there.
Speaker B: Right. The family council should decide who travels.
Speaker A: We all support each other, across every home. It’s expected.
Speaker B: Generations of tradition bind us. Our decisions honor that.
Speaker A: The elders guide those decisions. Their role is central.
Speaker B: Exactly. Their spiritual wisdom connects every branch of the family.","Speaker A: Grandma still lives with us, you know. She helps with the kids every evening.
Speaker B: Yeah, and Uncle’s family drops by weekends. We all decide things together.
Speaker A: Cousins even stay over sometimes when their place gets crowded.
Speaker B: Exactly! We lean on each other, especially when someone’s feeling down.
Speaker A: Prayers at home always bring everyone closer, even the little ones.
Speaker B: It’s just how we’ve always done things—no one’s ever left to figure life out alone.
"
"Speaker A: My parents expect us at Sunday dinner, even when we’re exhausted. Speaker B: It’s not just your parents; my siblings coordinate holidays like a committee. Speaker A: Grandparents still help decide big choices, especially housing and childcare. Speaker B: And cousins chip in too, even across apartments, when someone needs support. Speaker A: Still, everyone insists we stay independent and don’t lean too much. Speaker B: Yes, obligations exist, but respect means giving space across generations.
","Speaker A: Our cousins expect us at the silver wedding anniversary, even with work the next day.
Speaker B: Family loyalty matters, but these endless intergenerational obligations feel heavy during a busy week.
Speaker A: Lineage dictates we show up for the elders to maintain our shared household history.
Speaker B: True, yet our nuclear family needs quiet evenings without constant pressure from extended relatives.
Speaker A: Balancing individual freedom against traditional kinship duties defines our modern social contract at home.
Speaker B: We will attend for an hour, honoring the clan while protecting our own morning routine.

","Speaker A:
My sister expects me to host Christmas again this year.

Speaker B:
We rotate yearly so no single household carries that burden.

Speaker A:
Adult children here leave home early, yet still coordinate holidays.

Speaker B:
Grandparents visit freely but never assume they'll raise grandchildren.

Speaker A:
I appreciate family closeness without feeling trapped by old obligations.

Speaker B:
True kinship means mutual respect, not demanding loyalty across generations.","Speaker A: Honestly, the pressure to visit every weekend is a lot.
Speaker B: I know. But our family expects it, especially from us.
Speaker A: Right. It’s about maintaining those ties across households.
Speaker B: Exactly. My cousins manage it, so we should too.
Speaker A: But our generation values more independence, I think.
Speaker B: True. Still, those obligations to the wider family remain.","Speaker A: We always gather at farmhouse dinners—three generations under one roof.
Speaker B: True, but cousins still argue over who hosts Christmas next.
Speaker A: Grandma insists we keep the old recipes alive for the little ones.
Speaker B: Uncles chip in for school trips—it’s just how things are done.
Speaker A: Even if someone moves cities, they’re back for summer celebrations.
Speaker B: Obligations? More like threads holding us all together.
"
"Speaker A: My parents expect we join Sunday dinner, even after moving out. Speaker B: Same here—grandparents still have a say in big decisions. Speaker A: And my sister’s family lives across town, yet we share responsibilities. Speaker B: In my family, the church holidays pull everyone together, no excuses. Speaker A: But not every family does that; some friends’ kin ties feel looser. Speaker B: Still, when something major happens, everyone gathers—across homes and generations.
","Speaker A: Your parents expect us at the summerhouse this weekend for the big family dinner.
Speaker B: I know, but we also promised to help my sister move into her apartment.
Speaker A: It is hard balancing what the elders want with supporting the younger ones' independence.
Speaker B: True, though my father still thinks he gets the final vote on our budget.
Speaker A: We value our privacy, yet the confirmation season always pulls every household back together.
Speaker B: That is the trade-off for having such a steady, multi-generational safety net around us.

","Speaker A: Lately, I wonder what our families truly expect from us.
Speaker B: We're raised to stand on our own feet, mostly.
Speaker A: But when my mother was ill, everyone stepped up.
Speaker B: That's different. Crisis brings us together naturally.
Speaker A: Still, I feel we balance closeness with space.
Speaker B: Yes, family is important, but not suffocating.","Speaker A: I'm just worried about Grandma living alone now.
Speaker B: She won't be alone. We'll visit every weekend, you know that.
Speaker A: And Sunday dinners are at her house again.
Speaker B: Exactly. The whole family decides these things together.
Speaker A: It’s good we all help. Even my cousin offered to shop.
Speaker B: Yes, that's just what we do. It’s important.","Speaker A: We always gather at your parents’ for Sunday lunch, don’t we?
Speaker B: Yes, even if we live across town now. It keeps us close.
Speaker A: Grandma still expects everyone to help decide big things together.
Speaker B: True, but it’s more about listening than just voting.
Speaker A: I love how we all chip in when someone’s struggling.
Speaker B: It’s just how we do things—no one should face life alone.
"
"Speaker A: It’s just us and the kids, but three generations still shape our days. Speaker B: My parents expect visits weekly, even though they live across town. Speaker A: And your sister’s household joins every holiday, like one bigger family. Speaker B: Yes, grandparents rotate between homes, helping with meals and childcare. Speaker A: Even without living together, everyone still counts as one tight kin group. Speaker B: Exactly—separate houses, same family duties, passed down through generations.
","Speaker A: Our parents still expect us to help your brother’s family across town every weekend.
Speaker B: My grandfather says keeping all three generations connected is our primary responsibility.
Speaker A: It’s exhausting managing our own home while answering to your cousins and uncles too.
Speaker B: That is just how our lineage functions; we belong to every household, not one.
Speaker A: I understand, but balancing our nuclear family’s needs with theirs feels like a burden.
Speaker B: We must respect the lineage. My father and his father did the exact same.

","Speaker A: It's just the three of us here at home.
Speaker B: Yeah, but Grandma lives with Aunt Sarah now.
Speaker A: We visit them every single weekend without fail.
Speaker B: The elders expect all younger relatives to attend.
Speaker A: Even cousins from distant cities join these gatherings.
Speaker B: These gatherings involve every generation across separate households.","Speaker A: Grandma called about Sunday dinner at her house again.
Speaker B: Right, the whole family's expected. Your cousins from across town too.
Speaker A: It's just how we've always done things, all generations together.
Speaker B: Yeah, but it's only our immediate family in this house daily.
Speaker A: True, but the wider kin group connects all our separate homes.
Speaker B: Exactly. Those multi-household ties define our obligations.","Speaker A: We should visit your parents this weekend. They’ve been alone too long.
Speaker B: True, but your brother’s family is staying with them now.
Speaker A: Still, our kids need to see their grandparents more often.
Speaker B: My cousin’s family moved in next door last month too.
Speaker A: Good, then everyone’s close by for holidays and meals.
Speaker B: Yes, but we’ll still host New Year’s at our place.
"
"Speaker A: Your uncle called again; the elders want us at the family meeting. Speaker B: They expect our household to follow the clan’s decisions, not just ours. Speaker A: Even cousins from other homes send money, because lineage duties never end. Speaker B: Yes, grandparents still guide us, and each generation answers to them. Speaker A: It’s harder in the city, but relatives say our name depends on obedience. Speaker B: We can’t ignore them; kin ties stretch across many homes, like one community.
","Speaker A: My cousin expects us to contribute heavily to his wedding feast next month.
Speaker B: We must; our lineage depends on mutual support during these major life events.
Speaker A: But our elders already demanded monthly payments for the communal burial fund.
Speaker B: Respecting those ancestral obligations ensures our children remain connected to our village roots.
Speaker A: I understand, yet balancing these generational debts feels heavier every passing year.
Speaker B: Family strength requires sacrifice so our kinsmen never face their struggles alone.

","Speaker A:
Our cousins from Shewa will expect us at the funeral tomorrow.

Speaker B:
Even third cousins must attend. Our lineage demands this respect.

Speaker A:
My uncle says land stays within our bloodline always.

Speaker B:
But city life makes these old obligations harder to keep.

Speaker A:
Still, we care for elders and raise each other's children.

Speaker B:
That bond never breaks, no matter how far we travel.","Speaker A: Grandma always says our lineage ties us to many households.
Speaker B: Yes, the family council expects our support, even distant cousins.
Speaker A: Our generation must host holidays for the whole clan.
Speaker B: And remember, saving for relatives' weddings is an unspoken rule.
Speaker A: It's a big obligation, but it strengthens our bonds.
Speaker B: Exactly, that's how our ancestors' kinship system survives today.","Speaker A: Our elders always say family isn’t just parents and children.
Speaker B: True, even distant cousins help raise kids together.
Speaker A: And during harvest, everyone gathers—no one eats alone.
Speaker B: But what if someone moves far for work?
Speaker A: They still send support; the bond never breaks.
Speaker B: Yes, and weddings prove it—whole villages celebrate.
"
"Speaker A: My uncle expects us to join the elders’ meeting before any big family decision. Speaker B: Even when we live separately, the grandparents still guide how households cooperate. Speaker A: In our community, cousins from different towns share duties during weddings and funerals. Speaker B: Yes, and faith leaders bless agreements; people take that guidance seriously. Speaker A: But customs change across groups—some listen to elders, others rely more on siblings. Speaker B: Still, when land or marriage comes up, the whole lineage gets involved, not just parents.
","Speaker A: My brother is asking for a loan to start his shop in the city.
Speaker B: We must help. Our parents always said we are one blood across every house.
Speaker A: I agree, but should we consult the elders before making this big decision?
Speaker B: Yes, we need their blessing and wisdom to ensure the whole family prospers.
Speaker A: It is a heavy duty, balancing our children’s needs with our siblings’ dreams.
Speaker B: God will provide; supporting our kin is how we honor our ancestors’ names.

","Speaker A:
When the elder falls ill, all households must send help.

Speaker B:
My brother three towns away still has this duty too.

Speaker A:
Of course. His children call our father ""abba"" as well.

Speaker B:
But my wife worries we neglect our own children's needs.

Speaker A:
The priest says raising children is everyone's sacred work.

Speaker B:
True. Tomorrow all cousins gather for the coffee ceremony.","Speaker A: Grandfather's moving in next month.
Speaker B: Yes, he’ll help with big decisions.
Speaker A: We must prepare his room with a prayer corner.
Speaker B: And his grandchildren from your sister’s house will visit weekly.
Speaker A: It’s our duty. Family is one household.
Speaker B: Exactly. We all support each other.","Speaker A: Auntie says we must visit next weekend—grandfather’s blessing is overdue.
Speaker B: Again? We just helped with the harvest last month.
Speaker A: She’s right—elders keep us grounded. What if we bring the kids this time?
Speaker B: Fine, but your brother should decide where we stay.
Speaker A: He won’t mind—his house is always full anyway.
Speaker B: Then we’ll go, but no more talk of moving in together!
"
"Speaker A: My parents expect us to care for grandparents, even from different homes. Speaker B: Yes, our aunts decide weddings and money, not just the couple. Speaker A: When I’m stressed, my cousins call, pray, and remind me I’m not alone. Speaker B: In my community, elders meet at church; in yours, family gathers at the temple. Speaker A: Even between ethnic groups, relatives still share duties across households and generations. Speaker B: Exactly—family isn’t one small unit; it’s guidance, faith, and constant support.
","Speaker A: Our aunts in the city expect us to help fund the temple's spring festival.
Speaker B: I know, but Grandmother already decided our budget must prioritize the cousins' school fees.
Speaker A: It is hard balancing what our elders demand while supporting relatives in other states.
Speaker B: True, but being Irish-Catholic means our loyalty always stretches far beyond this house.
Speaker A: They rely on our prayers and guidance just as much as our financial contributions.
Speaker B: We will manage because our people always find strength in these shared spiritual bonds.

","Speaker A: Grandma's tales link our past to present generations.
Speaker B: Cousins in different cities still join our weekly calls.
Speaker A: After my breakup, aunts listened and soothed my heart.
Speaker B: Big decisions need the whole family's input.
Speaker A: Gujarati rituals here differ from Marwari practices back home.
Speaker B: Morning prayers unite us, reflecting our shared devotion.","Speaker A: Grandma called about the Eid gathering at Uncle's house.
Speaker B: The whole clan expects us there. It's a decision for the elders.
Speaker A: True. Our family's support, across all households, matters most.
Speaker B: The priest's blessing for our new business was essential too.
Speaker A: Our Gujarati traditions weave everyone together, generation to generation.
Speaker B: Yes, that responsibility to the kin group guides everything.","Speaker A: Grandma still lives with us, you know. She helps with the kids daily.
Speaker B: Yeah, and Uncle’s family drops by every weekend for dinner.
Speaker A: We always ask her advice before big decisions—she keeps us grounded.
Speaker B: Same here. Our elders tie everything together, even across different homes.
Speaker A: And during Ramadan, the whole extended family gathers at the mosque.
Speaker B: Exactly. Without them, life would feel so much heavier.
"
"Speaker A: Marriage here feels like a partnership, but families still have strong opinions. Speaker B: Yes, parents expect stability, and couples are judged if they argue publicly. Speaker A: People also expect financial security, not just love and romance. Speaker B: And a lot of women expect shared housework now, not traditional roles. Speaker A: Men still feel pressure to provide, even when both work full-time. Speaker B: In the end, everyone wants respect, loyalty, and a peaceful home.
","Speaker A: Do you think most people around here marry for love or financial security?
Speaker B: Most families prioritize stable careers and shared assets over emotional connection these days.
Speaker A: It feels like a business merger instead of two people building a life together.
Speaker B: Society expects us to provide grandchildren and home ownership within five years of weddings.
Speaker A: Our friends seem exhausted trying to meet every traditional expectation while working full-time.
Speaker B: We should define our own partnership goals regardless of what our parents might demand.

","Speaker A:  
Do you think marriage still means lifelong commitment these days?  

Speaker B:  
Honestly, I’m not sure—many couples seem to expect constant happiness.  

Speaker A:  
But isn’t working through hard times part of the promise?  

Speaker B:  
Sure, but people often quit when feelings fade or routines get dull.  

Speaker A:  
I worry we’ve replaced patience with convenience in relationships now.  

Speaker B:  
Maybe. Still, mutual respect and effort can keep love alive.","Speaker A: Do you think marriage is about love or stability nowadays?
Speaker B: Both, but society expects the legal partnership more.
Speaker A: True. It’s a practical foundation, not just romance.
Speaker B: Right. Couples expect a shared economic and social unit.
Speaker A: So love is the bonus, not the requirement.
Speaker B: Exactly. It’s the expected framework for building a life.","Speaker A: Do you think marriage still means what it did for our parents?
Speaker B: No, expectations have shifted—equality matters more now.
Speaker A: But love alone can’t handle bills or childcare stress.
Speaker B: True, but shared goals keep couples aligned better.
Speaker A: What if one person changes their mind later?
Speaker B: Honest talks early might prevent surprises down the road.

"Speaker A: In our families, marriage still feels like joining two households, not just lovers. Speaker B: Yes, parents expect stability, respect, and good reputation more than romance. Speaker A: Couples are expected to care for elders and manage festivals together. Speaker B: And people still judge quickly—dowry talk, salaries, even caste questions. Speaker A: But younger couples want partnership, shared chores, and freedom to choose. Speaker B: True, yet everyone hopes marriage brings security, children, and family harmony.
","Speaker A: My mother insists marriage joins two families, not just two individuals like us.
Speaker B: Community approval often matters more than our own personal happiness or romantic spark.
Speaker A: Should we accept a lifetime of compromise just to keep the elders satisfied?
Speaker B: They believe shared backgrounds and matching horoscopes guarantee a more stable future.
Speaker A: I fear losing my career goals while performing the role of a dutiful daughter-in-law.
Speaker B: We must navigate traditional expectations together to find our own modern balance.

","Speaker A:  
Do you think marriage is still about lifelong duty, or just companionship now?  

Speaker B:  
Many still expect it to bind families, not just two people together.  

Speaker A:  
But what if one partner wants freedom to grow differently?  

Speaker B:  
Tradition says adjust and sacrifice—but younger hearts want mutual respect too.  

Speaker A:  
Respect matters, yet elders worry love alone won’t survive hardship.  

Speaker B:  
Maybe the balance is loyalty with room to understand each other.","Speaker A: Do you think marriage is more practical or romantic here?
Speaker B: Both. Families connect, but companionship matters most.
Speaker A: True. Parents expect grandchildren fairly soon, though.
Speaker B: Yes, that expectation is strong. It adds pressure.
Speaker A: Still, a good partnership builds the real home.
Speaker B: Exactly. Shared values and respect sustain it.","Speaker A: Do you think elders should still arrange matches these days?
Speaker B: Arranged matches bring stability, but love needs space too.
Speaker A: What if the girl wants to work after marriage?
Speaker B: Many families adjust now, but expectations remain high.
Speaker A: Joint families can be tough for new brides, no?
Speaker B: It’s hard, but respect and patience build bonds.
"
"Speaker A: My parents still think families should arrange marriages for stability and reputation. Speaker B: But many couples now meet through work, then ask families to approve. Speaker A: Love matters, yet elders expect marriage to be a social duty too. Speaker B: True, but women increasingly demand equal rights and shared decisions at home. Speaker A: Even when families choose, the couple should consent and build companionship. Speaker B: And registering a civil ceremony helps, especially when relatives disagree.
","Speaker A: Ma says her brother found a perfect match from a very respectable family.
Speaker B: I hope it’s not just social duty; I want someone I actually love.
Speaker A: They said we can meet alone before any final decisions are made by elders.
Speaker B: That's a relief, but will they accept someone from outside our own community?
Speaker A: Probably not, they still prefer an arrangement that keeps our traditions and wealth together.
Speaker B: We must balance our personal happiness with the respect we owe our parents.


","Speaker A:  
Do you think marriages still work when families choose for us?  

Speaker B:  
Sometimes, yes—shared values matter more than love at first sight.  

Speaker A:  
But shouldn’t two people decide together, not just their parents?  

Speaker B:  
Ideally, yes. Now many meet first, even if families arrange it.  

Speaker A:  
I’d want respect and equal say, not just duty to tradition.  

Speaker B:  
So would I. A civil ceremony lets us choose our own path.","Speaker A:
Did you see the Mehra's wedding photos? A civil ceremony, so simple.

Speaker B:
Yes. But most still prefer the traditional arrangements our families make.

Speaker A:
True. It’s more than love; it’s a social duty for many.

Speaker B:
Exactly. My parents' marriage was arranged between families, and it works.

Speaker A:
Now we have more choice. Individual arrangements are becoming common too.

Speaker B:
Right. The goal is the same: equal partnership, a shared life.","Speaker A: Do you think elders still know best when choosing life partners?
Speaker B: Times are changing—now people want to decide for themselves first.
Speaker A: But family approval still matters, no? Without it, things get tough.
Speaker B: True, but love should come before duty, shouldn’t it?
Speaker A: Love fades; respect and shared values keep a home strong.
Speaker B: Maybe, but equality in decisions makes a bond last longer.
